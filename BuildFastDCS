Build FastDCS

Introduction
FastDCS can be built and run on a modern Linux system (with kernel version >= 2.6).

Build/Install Dependencies
CMake is used to manage and build the project.
Google Protocol Buffers is used for inter-worker communication and disk storage.
Install GCC
On Cygwin, run setup.exe and select gcc and binutils
On Debian/Ubuntu Linux
sudo apt-get install gcc binutils
On Mac OS X, install XCode
Install CMake
It is OK to install CMake in from binary package. But please be aware that we need a version larger than 2.8.0, because we used Google protocol buffers in FastDCS and older versions of CMake does not support protocol buffers.

To install CMake from binary packages using package managers:
You can also download binary and source packages of CMake from: http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html.

Install Protobuf
Download source code package (I am using protobuf-2.3.0.tar.bz2) from http://code.google.com/p/protobuf
Unpack the source code anywhere (e.g., ./protobuf-2.3.0)
You need to install protobuf into the standard path, e.g., /usr/local, because we need CMake be able to find the protobuf compiler:
$ cd protobuf-2.3.0
./configure
make
sudo make install
Add `export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/` to ~/.bashrc
Add `/usr/local/lib/` to `/etc/ld.so.conf`
$ ldconfig

Checkout the code for http://www.FastDCS.com/
Setup third-party libs:
Open FastDCS/CMakeLists.txt in a text editor. Find the line
set(THIRD_PARTY_DIR "/home/liuxun/3rd-party")
and replace /home/liuxun/3rd-party to where you have installed your 3rd-party libraries (referred to as /home/you/3rd-party in above section).
Setup the installation destination
If you want to use make install to install FastDCS into a directory, you tell CMake by replacing the line:
set(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX "/home/liuxun/FastDCS")
and replace /home/liuxun/FastDCS by the installation directory, say, /home/you/3rd-party/FastDCS.
Build FastDCS
With CMake, we usually build in a directory different from the source directory:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
